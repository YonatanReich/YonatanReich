### CS Student @ Bar-Ilan University | Disciplined Developer | End-to-End Solutions

I am a software engineer focused on delivering **tight, tailored products** designed specifically for the task at hand. I believe that modern development requires a balance: leveraging new technologies for efficiency while maintaining the rigorous discipline needed for technical precision.

- 🏗️ Building **scalable, end-to-end solutions** from the ground up.
- 🎯 Delivering **tightly tailored software** focused on specific user needs and efficiency.
- 🛠️ Maintaining a **keen eye for detail** in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.

## 💻 Technical Approach

- **Disciplined Development:** Prioritizing clean architecture and reliable execution over buzzwords.
- **Task-Tailored Solutions:** Analyzing the specific problem to select the most efficient tools for the job.
- **System-Level Awareness:** Leveraging modern tools to work faster without losing sight of architectural integrity.
