# Hi, I'm Yonatan 👋

### CS Student @ Bar-Ilan University | Systems-Focused Developer | Low-Level Optimizer

I am a software engineer focused on building high-performance systems where **technical discipline** meets **modern efficiency**. I believe in leveraging new technologies to accelerate development while remaining vigilant about low-level architectural precision.

- 🔍 Understanding the "why" behind the code through **Systems Programming** & **C++**.
- 🚀 Building scalable, end-to-end solutions from the ground up.
- 🛠️ Maintaining a keen eye for detail in a rapidly evolving tech landscape.
